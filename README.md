# UTM - Ultimate Magic & Tech (PRE-ALPHA) *
*This mod is very early alpha. Lots of testing and dev work to still be done. Use at your own risk <3

Huge modpack of 300+ mods! Adding tons of tech, magic, weapons, mobs, structures, biomes, bosses, and much much more for the Ultimate Modded experience!

Careful made with balance, compability, and proformance in mind. With tons of recipes and tags so that items from each mod can be used in each other (WIP)

# Known Issues

### The W for Wonder on tooltips is gone! D:
Still working on figuring out what is causing this as it is not consistent at all, but special thanks to [M0nkeyPr0grammer](https://modrinth.com/user/M0nkeyPr0grammer) for finding a temp fix! Reload your resource pack and close and open the menus. Wait a bit and it *should* fix if it hasn't already.

### Tooltips fading with achievements
